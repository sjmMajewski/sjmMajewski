My general research interest is developing mathematical languages and insights that would afford better understanding of living and cognitive processes, and aid the projects of building AI and ALife. On the technical side, the main theme of my research is optimization in the space of measures and it's applications in Machine Learning and Computational Statistics.

This blog is mostly an attempt to practice public writing, share some of my intellectual journey and connect with people interested in similar topics. If you think you might be such a person, my DMs on twitter are open :)
